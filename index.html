                    Hi there! My name is Marlon Delima Jr, and I recently graduated from New Era University with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I'm excited to pursue a career in web development and software development, and I'm currently looking for job opportunities in these fields.
                    <br><br> I have experience in developing websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I'm also proficient in programming languages such as Java and Python. During my studies, I completed several projects that involved building web applications and software programs.
                    <br><br> To showcase my skills and experience, I created a website that includes an "About Me" page. On this page, you can learn more about my background, skills, and interests. You can also view my resume and contact me if you're interested in discussing potential job opportunities.
                    <br><br> Please feel free to take a look at my website and reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your organization. I'm eager to put my skills to work and contribute to the success of your team. Thank you for your consideration!
